## 📣 Common Questions (FAQ)

**Will this break anything?**  
No. Our scans are read-only and built for safety in production environments.

**Do you need access to my systems?**  
For external scans, no access needed. For internal/Entra ID assessments, we’ll guide you through lightweight, temporary agent setup or access methods.

**How often should we scan?**  
Quarterly is our default, with optional one-offs. Security is a process, not a point-in-time event.

**Do your reports help with compliance?**  
Yes. Reports include NIST 800-171/CMMC mappings and help demonstrate active risk management.
