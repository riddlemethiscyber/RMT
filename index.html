                <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
                <p>Traditional cybersecurity often leaves critical gaps. Many organizations focus on known vulnerabilities but miss the **exploitable attack paths** and **hidden assets** that attackers target. Without continuous, expert-level testing, you might unknowingly be exposed to significant risk. This can lead to breaches, compliance issues, and costly downtime.</p>

                <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                <p>Riddle Me This Security closes these gaps. We provide **automated, advanced security assessments** that mimic real attackers, giving you clear, actionable insights into your true risk. We help you stay ahead of threats and ensure your peace of mind.</p>
