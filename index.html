                    <h3>Think Like an Attacker</h3>
                    <p>Traditional scanners find vulnerabilities. We find exploitable attack paths. Our service shows you exactly how a threat actor would chain together weaknesses to breach your systems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Continuous Validation</h3>
                    <p>Cyber threats don't wait for your annual pentest. Our service provides ongoing, autonomous testing to discover new risks as soon as they appear in your dynamic environment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Radical Prioritization</h3>
                    <p>Stop drowning in a sea of low-risk alerts. We prove exploitability, so your team can ignore the noise and focus 100% of their effort on fixing what is actually weaponizable.</p>

                    <p>Discover how an attacker could move laterally from a compromised workstation. We safely uncover weaknesses like weak credentials, Active Directory misconfigurations, and unpatched software to shut down attack paths.</p>

                    <h3>Validate Your Cloud Security</h3>
                    <p>Assess your AWS, Azure, and GCP environments for critical misconfigurations. We identify risky IAM roles, public-facing services, and vulnerabilities that could lead to a cloud data breach.</p>
